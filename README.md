👨‍💻 About Me — Temesgen Teka
I’m a software engineering student based in Ethiopia, passionate about building real-world systems that solve practical problems. 
I learn by doing — writing code manually, debugging layouts, and refining every detail until it works. 
My journey is driven by responsibility, creativity.
